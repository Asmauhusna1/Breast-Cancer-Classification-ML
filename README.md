Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning & Deep Learning
This project classifies breast tumors as Benign or Malignant using various machine learning models and a neural network.
It’s built with Python and popular ML frameworks such as Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and TensorFlow/Keras.

Dataset
The dataset Cancer_Data.csv is derived from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset, which includes features extracted from images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.
Each feature describes characteristics of the cell nuclei, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and area.
