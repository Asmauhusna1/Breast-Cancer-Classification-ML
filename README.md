📊 Dataset
The dataset Cancer_Data.csv` is derived from the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.  
It includes features extracted from images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses.  
Each feature describes characteristics of the cell nuclei such as:
- Radius  
- Texture  
- Perimeter  
- Area  
- Smoothness
